"This lady called, emailed, faxed, and began texting my employer several times yesterday and the day prior requesting them to verify and fill out my personal information to verify my employment for a loan. I am unsure if she just wanted my social or if someone is taking a loan out in my name; I have attached the email she sent as well. I do not need a loan, I bought a house in August and have verified with my actual lender that this is a scam and was told to report it to BBB.  Thankfully, my boss realized it was a scam (partly due to the unprofessional manner of sending multiple faxes and texts in one day) and contacted me about it before sending them information.
Please see attached emails below:
""I am following up on the fax I sent over previously in regards to employment verification for Jessica Brown on behalf of Lenderworks. I sent the fax to 7722421296. If there is an alternate email address or fax number to send the forms to, please let me know. Once you have completed the verification, please respond to this email and let me know to avoid further follow-up emails.
Keep in mind they are waiting on this information to move forward with their process, so we need this completed within the next business day to avoid delays and cancellations. Your prompt assistance with this information is greatly appreciated.

Our records indicate that you are eligible to receive restitution for one or more of the Internet fraud schemes of which you have been a victim. Please see the necessary case details below. Case about detained internet scammers from African countries who were arrested for serious crimes.
The case was closed based on the following terms:
Restitution order: the seized assets will be liquidated and converted into a restitution fund.
Time served plus 10 years probation means all scammers will be in jail for the next 10 years.
The perpetrator and his accomplices had more than 2,000 aliases from Russia, Nigeria, Ghana, London and many African countries that masked their original identities. Our records indicates that you have been a victim of fraud because your contact details were found on several devices belonging to the perpetrator.
Following court orders, this makes you eligible to receive restitution for the damages caused by this criminal being that (subject) operated on an international scale and victimized thousands of people and companies of various nationalities. We determined that the investigation should be kept private and away from public media to maintain a unitary approach and integrity in international relations. Because this was a private investigation, all victims (including you) were represented by a court-appointed professional public defender(Law Firm) with more than 10 years of experience in similar cases. Having consistently pursued the (subjects) case for two years, he successfully achieved restitution payments of $25 million for each victim.

Hi *****!
I hope you're doing well! I ordered some items from your store about five days ago, and while the payment went through on my credit card, I haven't received any shipping details yet.
Could you please help me check the status of my order? I'm in a bit of a rush to receive the items, so any information you could provide today would be greatly appreciated!
I've attached the order invoice for your reference.
Thank you so much for your help!
Best,

Good morning!
I just wanted to forward you this email from a customer who's been having trouble with her order from last week. We spoke on the phone earlier, and she sent over her invoice, but I'm having a bit of trouble locating her order.
Could you take a look and see if you can find any details? It would really help me out!
Thanks so much!

I responded with this SMS: “ Hello
Where are you?
Don't you want to inspect the trailer and learn more about it?
This seems a little suspicious as you're ready to pay but haven't even seen the camper.

This is Kristine reaching out.
So many people want to use GLP-1 for health benefits and weight loss. Maybe you are one of them. Medicines like Ozempic, Wegovy, and Rybelsus are expensive and hard to get ahold of.
We can help you.
I am a health specialist with GetReliefRX, a small group of doctors, pharmacists, and health coaches out of Billings, MT. Unlike other groups, we are offering you:
- A $0 medical consultation
- All our medicines are oral gels - no shots, no pills, high absorption
- Only $149 for your first month of medicine
- 3 choices of GLP-1s - Rybelsus, Generic Semaglutide, Tirzepatide
- $0 Health coaching
Why are we so cost effective and why do we offer so many benefits that others don't? Because we are grounded in the medical benefits of GLP-1s, and we truly want to help people with affordable solutions.
You can learn more about GetReliefRX by going to https://getreliefrx.com/glp1/?utm_source=5345444.

"Hello,
I received the following text today (Wednesday 10/9/2024). I coincidentally went to a USPS earlier today, which I seldom do, to deliver an online retail return for my mother to send back to the seller. Unfortunately, I did fall for it. I was prompted to enter in information at the link for her home address, phone number, and e-mail. I entered these in then on the next screen was asked for a $0.23 payment to cover the package re-sending fee. I entered my credit card number then submit, but nothing happened. I then tried it using my debit card, and nothing happened either. I then realized (too late) that the link in the text message didn't look right. I have a feeling I was phished. I called my bank and canceled all my cards and requested replacements. I am now afraid for my parents after putting in my mother's address believing that USPS couldn't read her address on the package (reasons I thought they were sending me the text). Does this put the safety of my parents at risk since I inputted their home address?
Below is what the text message stated.

This is Richard Williams, Intellectual Property Attorney at Visionary Trademark. I am writing to inform you that we have received a trademark application for a business name identical to yours, [RECIPIENT BUSINESS NAME]. However, it appears that your business name is not registered federally with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), which allows others to proceed with their registration.
Please be advised that, under the protocols of the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and intellectual property regulations, priority is generally given to the original business owner over subsequent applicants. Therefore, it is crucial to confirm whether you are interested in securing federal trademark rights for your business name.
If you wish to proceed with the registration, please respond to this email so we can guide you through the necessary steps.
Please be advised that if you choose not to register the trademark, the other applicant will be allowed to proceed, as the USPTO processes applications on a first-come, first-served basis.
Your prompt response is required. The other applicant's registration is currently on hold pending your decision till next two business days. If we do not receive a response to this letter, the other applicant will be allowed to proceed with their registration in accordance with the standard examination and filing procedures at the USPTO.
Pursuant to the Lanham Act (15 U.S.C. §§ 1051 et seq.), it is necessary to register your mark to secure federal ownership rights.

This is a final notice regarding the trademark application for ""******** *********** *******"" As previously communicated, another party has initiated the trademark filing for this name. However, after conducting a detailed investigation, we discovered that they are a new startup with only a few months of usage of the name. On the other hand, your business has a well-established and proven history of using this name for a longer period.
As per our company’s policy, we are offering you first priority to file for the trademark, given your legitimate and proven use of the name. However, time is of the essence, and we require a response within 24 hours to proceed with the filing.
What happens next:
If you choose to proceed: We will immediately file your trademark application with CIPO to ensure full protection of your rights and ownership of the name.
If we do not hear from you: We will proceed with the other party’s filing, as CIPO follows a first-come, first-served policy.
If the other party successfully registers the trademark, they will gain exclusive rights to the name, and you will no longer have the legal right to use it. Under Canada’s Trade-marks Act, this could lead to potential trademark infringement claims, legal penalties, financial damages, and even a lawsuit for continued use of the name. Furthermore, the other party may issue a cease-and-desist order, severely disrupting your business operations.
We strongly urge you to take swift action to protect your rights. If we do not hear from you within 24 hours, we will proceed with the other party’s application, as we cannot hold the filing indefinitely.

"I received two emails from this fake Trademark Attorney stating that another company wanted to trademark my company name and that they realized my company had been using it longer. He stated even though we have been using the name longer, if another company registers for a trademark on the name that you will not be able to use the name anymore if their trademark is approved. Below is the first email, and below is the follow-up email after I replied to the first message stating that we plan to continue using the company name and provide me with the necessary steps.

Subject: Trademark Conflict, immediate action required
**** ****** I hope you’re doing well. I’m reaching out on behalf of the Legal Department at Elite Mark Group, a private firm specializing in trademark and copyright legal services. We’ve recently received a request from an applicant in North Carolina who wants to trademark a name that is identical to “Streamer"" which you are currently using for similar services. Our preliminary investigation indicates that you have been using this business name for quite some time. In accordance with our company policy, we prioritize the rights of established businesses over those of newcomers.
According to the USPTO records, the name “Streamer"" is not currently trademarked and does not appear in the United States Patent & Trademark Office database. Legally, if a name isn’t trademarked, it is available for registration by anyone in the U.S., regardless of how long it has been in use. The key factor is the existence of a valid trademark; if another party registers the trademark before you, they will have a legal edge, even if you’ve been using the name longer.
Federal trademark registration grants the holder ownership rights and may limit your ability to use the name “Streamer"" They could also take legal action against you, which might lead to claims on any profits you’ve made under that name.
Please let me know if you intend to use this name legally in the future, so I can assist you with the necessary steps. It’s important to remember that, as outlined in the Lanham Act of 1946 (§§ 1051 et seq), federal registration is crucial for establishing ownership rights.
Your prompt attention to this matter is vital for protecting your rights and avoiding any potential legal complications. We look forward to your response.
Best regards,
Richard S Michaels

Subject: Final Confirmation Required: Urgent Action Needed for Trademark Registration of Your Business Name
**** ***** Trust this correspondence finds you in good health.
This serves as our conclusive attempt to communicate with you regarding the formal registration of the business name ""Streamer"" Failure to receive your confirmation for registration by the end of today will necessitate our progression with an alternative applicant by tomorrow, potentially resulting in the forfeiture of your entitlement to utilize the  “Streamer"".
In adherence to our meticulous trademark registration procedures, we conduct comprehensive assessments on search engines and social media platforms to ascertain the distinctiveness of the brand name. Absent confirmation from the current user within the specified 24 to 48 business hours, we will proceed with the interested party's registration.
Trademark conflict constitutes a breach of civil laws, with potential repercussions involving court-ordered cessation of trademark usage. Furthermore, financial restitution may be mandated, encompassing the surrender of profits derived from the infringing use or payment of monetary damages. The penalties for trademark infringement may include injunctive relief or the issuance of a cease-and-desist directive.
Recognizing your historical utilization of the brand for an extended period, we acknowledge the possibility of exercising discretion in refraining from legal proceedings with the alternate party, particularly if they represent a startup entity. If your intention is to assert ownership of the business name ""Streamer,"" a swift response is imperative to facilitate guidance through the registration process.
Your immediate attention to this matter is appreciated, and we anticipate your expeditious response.
Thanks & Regards,

I immediately replied to his email, and stated I couldn't find information about him with the supplied web link and google searched his actual location, which was listed as an apartment. He replied with a clearly fake web page (I reverse image searched, and ""handsome lawyer"" stock images appeared). None of the information he supplied made sense once I started researching it. I also realized that the original web url was purchased this month. At first glance this seems legitimate, so I'm reporting it to save other businesses the time and effort to avoid this scam.
Below is the email with the links that I researched:

"""Jack"" pretended to be a patent Lawyer representing a client who is about to file the same trademark as my company.  E-Mail is below:
I wanted to bring to your attention that, according to CIPO (Canadian Intellectual Property Office) records, the business name "" CRRAL.com "" is currently not trademarked and does not appear in the records of the Canadian Intellectual Property Office. As per legal considerations, a name not trademarked is regarded as an open entity available for registration or trademarking by any entity within the Canada. The duration a company has been using the name holds less significance than the validity of the trademark itself. If another company or individual secures the trademark before you do, they will have an advantage, irrespective of the duration of your current usage.
Upon our research, we noted that your company has been using this business name for several years, and our applicant has also been utilizing the name for the past couple of years. Considering this, we would like to offer you our trademark services. Our aim is to assist you in securing your business name and identity through trademark registration, ensuring 100% ownership rights under your ownership.
Operating without trademark protection poses significant risks to your company. Without legal barriers in place, other businesses could use the same name, leading to confusion among customers and potential dilution of your brand identity. Moreover, if the other company successfully trademarks the name, they could gain exclusive rights to its use, forcing your company to rebrand at considerable expense.
According to our company policy, we prioritize applicants who have a more established and legitimate usage of the business name compared to our current applicant, who is a startup business. Given your extensive history in the industry, we believe you deserve full ownership of your business name. We're eager to assist you in securing 100% ownership rights under your name. Based on our research, it's evident that you are more deserving of ownership compared to the current applicant. Let us help you protect your brand and ensure its longevity in the market.
Our team consists of professional intellectual property attorneys, each possessing over a decade of experience in their respective fields. If you are interested, we can discuss the detailed process and associated costs at your convenience. I am open to discussing this matter further and addressing any questions or concerns you may have.

-Landing Page Design- The first thing we'll do is create a landing page for your book. This page will be designed to grab the attention of potential readers and encourage them to learn more about your book and ultimately purchase it. We'll make sure the page is eye-catching and highlights the key selling points of your book. It’ll also be used to build email list of interested readers who we’ll campaign your books to.
-Mockup designs- We will design different eye catching mockup designs to catch the attention of readers and to beautify your book
-Social media marketing- After the landing page is designed, we'll move on to social media marketing. We'll create a social media strategy that targets your target audience and drives them to your landing page. We will help you create and share engaging content on social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram. This can help you reach new readers and build relationships with potential fans.
-Email marketing - Finally, we'll set up an email marketing campaign to nurture potential readers and encourage them to make a purchase. Email marketing is the process of commercially presenting, promoting, and advertising your books by email to the group of people who enjoy reading your book niche in order to persuade them to buy.
-Newsletter - A newsletter is a very powerful tool for book promotion and marketing. It allows you to directly communicate with your audience and keep them updated on your book and any new developments. You can use the newsletter to announce new releases, share behind-the-scenes information, and even offer special deals and discounts to your subscribers. Having a strong newsletter can help you build a loyal following and keep readers engaged with your work and it’s the best tools to sell as many copies as possible in few days or weeks.

Shortly after completing the application online and submitting it, I received an email from: verifications@ptoofficesusa.online, Name: Raul Gonzalez, Patent and Trademark Attorney, claiming that I had (subject line) ""Missing Documentation for Your USPTO Trademark Application"", I fell for it because the timing was uncanny, I had never applied for a trademark and it happened shortly after I had. Here is the body of the email (received: Feb 25, 2025, 8:30?PM):
(Hello, good day (my name),
I hope this message finds you well.
As we continue processing your trademark application with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), we have identified some necessary items that require your immediate attention. In order to proceed with your application and avoid any potential delays, email the following:
Proof of Address: Please submit documentation verifying your business address.
Designation in Business: Kindly provide details regarding your role or title within the business.
Social Media/Website Presence: Please share links to your website, Google business page, or any relevant social media profiles. If not applicable, kindly indicate that they are currently unavailable.
Without these documents and information, your trademark application may be at risk of rejection. To ensure timely processing, we kindly request that you submit the necessary documents at your earliest convenience.
Should you have any questions or require further assistance, please do not hesitate to contact us.
Thank you for your immediate attention to this matter. )
I did submit my proof address doc and replied to this email. I then received a second email with a link requesting, which I then realized this was a scam and did not submit or send any money. Today in the mail, I received a letter which looks to be like the same company that had sent me the initial scam email ""PSO"" from 110 Traders Cross, 1st Floor, Bluffton, SC 29909 (info@pso-register.com and www.pso-register.com) requesting I send a check for $1,450.00, which I am not going to do. It is so sad when someone is just trying to start a company and is tight on money and these predators somehow receive your information and start to email you claiming they are someone they are not. I hope they can be stopped with this information and it will not happen to anyone else, which sadly I think it will, but maybe sharing this info will help. thank you!",phishing_url,0.9880453944206238,"{'legitimate_email': 0.011897013522684574, 'phishing_url': 0.9880453944206238, 'legitimate_url': 4.0685918065719306e-05, 'phishing_url_alt': 1.6930984202190302e-05}"

*******************************
This is Brian Collins, IP Attorney at Matrix IPO. We would like to inform you that we have received a trademark application for a business name identical to yours ********* ********. Should this application proceed, and the applicant secures federal ownership and protection for the trademark, you would be required to cease all usage of this name in accordance with the Patent & Custom Law and the United States Trademark Law.
The application is currently being processed with the United States Patent & Trademark Office for trademark registration. During our research in the IP databases, your information was identified. According to USPTO and intellectual property protocols, priority is generally given to the original user of the business name/mark over a new applicant. Thus, we are reaching out to ascertain your interest in securing federal trademark rights for your business name.
If you do not wish to register the trademark, we will proceed with the federal registration for the other applicant, as trademarks are awarded on a first-come, first-served basis rather than first use.
We kindly request your prompt response, as the other applicant’s registration process is currently on hold pending your decision. If we do not hear from you within the next two business days, we will proceed with the registration for the other applicant according to the standard examination and filing procedures of the USPTO.
As stipulated by the Lanham Act (Act of 1946, §§ 1051 et seq.), federal registration is mandatory to secure ownership rights.
Sincerely,
Brian D. Collins

She then came back on the phone and said we can settle for 700. I didn’t want it to affect my credit so I went and paid it by credit card and then hindsight I probably shouldn’t have done that.

"""Hi.
This is the last warning.
I hacked your operating system.
All personal data from your devices has been copied to my servers. I have access to your messengers, social networks, emails, chat history and contact list.
My virus constantly updates signatures (it is driver-based) so it remains invisible to antivirus software.
While collecting information about you, I found out that you are a big fan of adult websites.
You really like to visit porn sites and watch dirty videos while having an orgasm.
I've already made a screen capture.
It's a montage of the pornographic video you were watching at the time and your masturbation.
Your face is perfectly visible.I do not think this kind of content will have a positive impact on your reputation.
I can send this video to everyone who knows you.
I also have no problem with making all of your personal information public on the Internet.
I think you know what I mean. It would be a real disaster for you. I could ruin your life forever.
I think you really do not want that to happen.
Let's solve it this way: you transfer me 1300 dollars (USD) (in Bitcoin equivalent at the exchange rate at the moment of funds transfer), and I will immediately remove all this dirt from my servers. After that we will forget about each other.
Bitcoin wallet for payment:
1Bkka7HcZ1noLpS94gpcvwsYMr2BoZUtkX
(If you do not know how to transfer money and what Bitcoin is. Use Google.)
I give you 2 working days to transfer the money. The timer started automatically as soon as you opened the email. I will receive a notification about the opening of this email.
Do not try to complain anywhere, as there is no way to track the wallet, the mail from where the letter came, and is not tracked and created automatically, so there is no point in writing to me.
Do not try to contact the police and other security services, otherwise your data will be published.
Changing passwords in social networks, mail, device will not help you, because all the data is already downloaded to a cluster of my servers.
Good luck and do not do anything stupid. Think about your future.""",phishing_url,0.999977707862854,"{'legitimate_email': 2.2118851120467298e-05, 'phishing_url': 0.999977707862854, 'legitimate_url': 5.2261526661823154e-08, 'phishing_url_alt': 8.544671459276287e-08}"

********,

I will cut to the chase. You do not know anything about me however I know you and you must be thinking why are you receiving this e-mail, right?
I actually installed a Malware on porn website and guess what, you accessed this sexwebsite to experience pleasure (if you know what I mean). And when you got busy watching our videos, your system started out working as a RDP (Remote Control) having a key logger which provided me with accessibility to your screen and also your camera recordings. Right after that, my malware collected all of your data and your complete contacts from device including your entire photos.
WhatIwant?
It is just your hard luck that I found your blunder. I then put in more days than I probably should've investigating into your data and made a double-screen video. 1st part displays the recording you were viewing and 2nd part displays the recording from your webcam (it is you doing dirty things). Genuinely, I want to destroy details about you and allow you to continue with your regular life. And I am going to present you two options that can accomplish your freedom. The two choices are either to turn a blind eye to this letter (not recommended), or pay me a small amount to end this chapter forever.

Let’s examine those two options in more detail. Option One is to turn a deaf ear this mail. Let me tell you what is going to happen if you take this option. I will send out your sextape to all your contacts including family members, colleagues, and so forth. It does not protect you from the humiliation your household will ought to feel when relatives and buddies find out your sordid sextape in their inbox. Wise option is to pay me, and be confidential about it. We will call this my “confidentiality tip”. Now Lets see what will happen if you opt this path. Your dirty secret remains private. I will keep my mouth closed. After you pay, You continue on with your lifetime and family as if nothing like this ever happened.

"Received the following porn blackmail email notification to my work email account
""Hello pervert,
I want to inform you about a very bad situation for you. However, you can benefit from it, if you will act wisely.
Have you heard of Pegasus?
This is a spyware program that installs on computers and smartphones and allows hackers to monitor the activity of device owners.
It provides access to your webcam, messengers, emails, call records, etc. It works well on Android, iOS, and Windows.
I guess, you already figured out where I'm getting at.
It's been a few months since I installed it on all your devices because you were not quite choosy about what links to click on the internet.
During this period, I've learned about all aspects of your private life, but one is of special significance to me.
I've recorded many videos of you jerking off to highly controversial porn videos.
Given that the ""questionable"" genre is almost always the same, I can conclude that you have sick perversion.
I doubt you'd want your friends, family and co-workers to know about it. However, I can do it in a few clicks.
Every number in your contact book will suddenly receive these videos - on WhatsApp, on Telegram, on Skype, on email - everywhere.
It is going to be a tsunami that will sweep away everything in its path, and first of all, your former life.
Don't think of yourself as an innocent victim. No one knows where your perversion might lead in the future, so consider this a kind of deserved punishment to stop you.
Better late than never.
I'm some kind of God who sees everything.
However, don't panic. As we know, God is merciful and forgiving, and so do I.
But my mercy is not free.
Transfer $1400 USD to my bitcoin wallet: bc1qzvfq7t8lzjdfxe2ehcuqcfqwygp77rus496a05
Once I receive confirmation of the transaction, I will permanently delete all videos compromising you, uninstall Pegasus from all of your devices, and disappear from your life. You can be sure - my benefit is only money.
Otherwise, I wouldn't be writing to you but destroy your life without a word in a second.
I'll be notified when you open my email, and from that moment you have exactly 48 hours to send the money.
If cryptocurrencies are unchartered waters for you, don't worry, it's very simple.
Just google ""crypto exchange"" and then it will be no harder than buying some useless stuff on Amazon.
I strongly warn you against the following:) Do not reply to this email. I sent it from a temp email, so I am untraceable.) Do not contact the police. I have access to all your devices, and as soon as I find out you ran to the cops, videos will be published.) Don't try to reset or destroy your devices.
As I mentioned above: I'm monitoring all your activity, so you either agree to my terms or the videos are published.
Also, don't forget that cryptocurrencies are anonymous, so it's impossible to identify me using the provided address.
Good luck, my perverted friend. I hope this is the last time we hear from each other.

mike super,
I know that calling 7152893540 or visiting 653 tower dr would be a effective way to contact you if you don't take
action. Don't even try to hide from this. You've no idea what I'm capable of in cadott.
It's important you pay attention to this message right now. Take a moment to chill, breathe, and analyze it thoroughly. 'Cause
we're about to discuss a deal between you and me, and I ain't playing games. You do not know me but I know you very well
and you must be wondering how, right?
Well, you've been treading on thin ice with your browsing habits, scrolling through those videos and venturing into the darker
corners of cyberspace. I actually placed a Malware on a porn website and you accessed it to watch(know what I mean?).
When you were watching videos, your smartphone began functioning as a RDP (Remote Device) which provided me with
total access to your device. I can look at everything on your display, switch on your camera and mic, and you wouldn't have a
clue. Oh, and I have got access to all your emails, contacts, and social media accounts too.
Been keeping tabs on your pathetic life for a while now. It is just your hard luck that I found your blunder. I put in more days
than I should have investigating into your personal life. Extracted quite a bit of juicy info from your system. and I've seen it all.
Yeah, Yeah, I've got footage of you doing embarrassing things in your room (nice setup, by the way). I then developed videos
and screenshots where on one side of the screen, there's the videos you were watching, and on the other part, it is someone
doing naughty things. With just a click, I can send this garbage to all of your contacts.
I feel your worry and confusion. Frankly, I am ready to wipe the slate clean, and allow you to move on with your life and wipe
your slate clean. I will offer you two alternatives.
First Choice is to ignore this mail. You should know what will happen if you pick this path. Your video will get sent to your
entire contacts. The video is straight fire, and I can't even fathom the embarrasement you'll endure when your colleagues,
friends, and fam check it out. But hey, that's life, ain't it? Don't be playing the victim here.
Option 2 is to pay me, and be confidential about it. Weâ€™ll name this my â€oeconfidentiality tipâ€ . Now Lets see what will
happen when you select this path. Your dirty secret remains private. I will wipe everything clean once you send payment. You
will make the payment via Bitcoin only. I want you to know I'm aiming for a win-win here. I will keep my end of the bargain.

"I am writing to bring to your attention serious concerns regarding the business practices of **FVAChatting.com** (""FVAChatting"") that may warrant regulatory scrutiny. Based on a detailed review of their publicly available **Terms of Service (https://www.fvachatting.com/terms)**, **Privacy Policy (https://www.fvachatting.com/privacy)**, and marketing statements on their website, I respectfully request that your office investigate whether FVAChatting is operating in compliance with state and federal consumer protection and privacy laws.
The information available suggests that FVAChatting may be engaging in deceptive practices and failing to adequately protect consumer privacy, particularly with regard to interactions involving OnlyFans subscribers. My concerns center around the potential misrepresentation of their services, misleading consumer interactions, and questionable data collection practices that may affect your residents.
### 1. Potentially Deceptive Practices Under the FTC Act
The **Federal Trade Commission Act (FTC Act)** prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices in commerce ([15 U.S.C. § 45](https://www.ftc.gov/about-ftc/what-we-do/enforcement-authority)). Deceptive practices are defined as material misrepresentations or omissions that are likely to mislead a reasonable consumer ([FTC v. Cyberspace.com LLC, 453 F.3d 1196 (9th Cir. 2006)]).
- **Concern**: FVAChatting markets its services with claims such as:
> “Outsource Your OnlyFans Chatting Today”
> “Clone Your Persona: Our chatters will clone your persona and work on scaling your account.”
> “Get 5x more sales in OnlyFans Chatting. At FVA Chatting, we don't just chat, we charm, we captivate, we create cash flows.”
These statements imply that OnlyFans models (account holders) are directly engaging with their fans. However, the **Terms of Service (https://www.fvachatting.com/terms)** and **Privacy Policy (https://www.fvachatting.com/privacy)** reveal that interactions are conducted by representatives hired by FVAChatting who impersonate the models without disclosing this to subscribers.
- **Impact on Consumers**: Many subscribers may be under the impression they are interacting directly with the models when, in fact, they are speaking to hired representatives. This lack of transparency can significantly influence consumer decisions, potentially violating the FTC Act.
- **Relevant Legal Precedents**:
- In **FTC v. Willow Labs LLC (2017)**, the court found that misleading representations about the nature of a service violated the FTC Act.
- The **FTC v. Cyberspace.com LLC (2006)** case underscores that failure to disclose critical information, particularly where it affects consumer behavior, can constitute a deceptive practice.
### 2. Potential Violations of State Consumer Protection Laws (California and New York)
**California Business and Professions Code § 17200 (Unfair Competition Law)** and **New York General Business Law § 349** prohibit deceptive or unfair business practices.
- **California**: The **Privacy Policy (https://www.fvachatting.com/privacy)** indicates that FVAChatting collects extensive personal data, including sensitive information such as social security numbers and passport details. However, the purpose behind collecting such sensitive data is not clearly explained. The marketing statements such as **“Get 5x more sales”** may mislead consumers into believing they are directly interacting with the models, rather than hired representatives.
- **Legal Precedent**: The California Supreme Court in **Kwikset Corp. v. Superior Court (2011)** affirmed that consumers misled by deceptive marketing practices have standing to sue under the Unfair Competition Law. Similarly, **People v. JTH Tax, Inc. (2013)** emphasized that deceptive business practices can result in significant legal consequences.
- **New York**: Statements suggesting direct communication with models, such as **“propelling creators to the zenith of OnlyFans success”**, could be seen as deceptive under **New York General Business Law § 349**, which prohibits practices likely to mislead consumers.
- **Legal Precedent**: In **Gaidon v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of America (1999)**, the court found that misleading practices materially affecting consumers’ decisions violated state law.
### 3. Privacy and Data Protection Concerns Under the CCPA/CPRA
The **California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)** and **California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA)** provide California residents with rights over their personal data, including the right to know what data is collected and how it is used.
- **Concern**: The Privacy Policy at **https://www.fvachatting.com/privacy** discloses that FVAChatting collects extensive data, including **IP addresses, passport numbers, and device identifiers**, but does not adequately explain why this information is necessary for chat services.
- **Potential Non-Compliance**: The CCPA requires companies to clearly disclose their data collection practices and allow consumers to opt out of the sale of their personal data. FVAChatting’s vague language around the purposes of data collection may not align with these legal requirements.
- **Relevant Legal Precedent**: In **People v. Equifax Inc. (2020)**, California regulators enforced penalties for inadequate disclosures related to sensitive data collection.
### 4. Potential Non-Compliance with the GDPR
If FVAChatting processes the personal data of EU residents, it may be subject to the **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**. The **Schrems II (2020)** decision emphasized the need for robust safeguards when transferring personal data outside the EU.
- **Concern**: The Privacy Policy suggests that data may be transferred internationally, potentially without adequate protection, which could violate GDPR requirements.
### 5. Lack of Clear Contact Information
The **Privacy Policy** only lists a generic support email (**support@fvachatting.com**) with no physical address or phone number. This lack of transparency may not comply with the **California Online Privacy Protection Act (CalOPPA)**, which mandates clear contact information for consumer inquiries.
### Request for Investigation
Based on the concerns outlined above, I respectfully request that your office investigate whether FVAChatting’s practices comply with:
- The **Federal Trade Commission Act (FTC Act)**
- **California Business and Professions Code § 17200** and **New York General Business Law § 349**
- The **California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)** and **California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA)**
- The **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**, if applicable
- The **Lanham Act** regarding false advertising
### Conclusion
The potentially misleading practices and privacy concerns described above suggest that FVAChatting’s actions may have significant implications for consumers, particularly those who believe they are engaging directly with OnlyFans models. While I may not be a resident of your state, the potentially inappropriate business practices by FVAChatting could impact your residents who need your protection. I urge your office to conduct a thorough investigation to ensure that FVAChatting complies with all applicable laws.

Hi David,
Thank you for your kind words. I’m so glad to hear that you and Ashley are interested.
Storing the piano until late September or early October is not a problem, so you can rest easy on that front. I just sent the moving company a message and instructed them to release the piano to you. All you need to do now is to contact them and make an arrangement regarding the moving process. I would like you to take some pictures/videos when they arrive at your address.

Hi Gina,
That’s really wonderful. I’ll certainly bring this up with my fiancée, Ashley. I think we’re both quite interested.
If you’d be willing to forward the movers’ information to me, I’d be grateful to inquire about their moving costs. This is such a generous way to honor your late husband. I’d be delighted to learn more about his life and history with and love for music if you’d be willing to share.
Again, I would not be able to take possession of it until late September or early October, but if the storage until then is not a problem, and if the moving costs are reasonable, I’d gladly pay the delivery fee.
Many thanks and all best,

Subject: RE: Grand Piano 08/8
Hello David,
Thanks for your message.
The Yamaha Baby Grand Piano GC1 model used to be owned and played by my husband who passed away last year, the dimension is ""161cm by 149cm”. It was last tuned two months ago. She's about 3 years old and in an impeccable condition.
I'm relocating to France next two weeks, and I don't think my husband will be happy if I sell this piano, so I'm hoping to give it out to someone who is a passionate lover of the instrument, and you can have it if you want it or forward my email/pictures to anyone who’s interested in the instrument. I wasn't going to leave it alone in an empty house.
The Piano is currently in storage in Little Rock, Arkansas with the movers I employed to move my properties from my house. I can forward you the movers’ contact details to enable you to contact them. The movers can deliver anywhere. I have attached pictures of the instrument for you. However, I will not be responsible for the cost of delivering the piano to you. However, the movers' rates are reasonably affordable.
I look forward to your reply.

The Yamaha Baby Grand Piano GC1 model belonged to my late husband, who passed away last year. The dimensions are 161cm by 149cm, and it was last tuned two months ago. The piano is about three years old and in impeccable condition.
I’m relocating to France in two weeks, and I’d prefer to give the piano to someone who genuinely loves the instrument, as I don’t feel right about selling it. If you're interested, or know someone who might be, please feel free to share my email. I didn’t want to leave it behind in an empty house. I have attached pictures of the instrument for you.
The piano is currently stored in a climate-controlled facility in Little Rock, Arkansas, with the movers handling the relocation of my belongings. If you'd like to arrange for delivery, I can provide you with their contact details. They offer reasonable rates, but please note that I will not be covering the cost of delivery.

My sister told me about you and i would love to give you the piano,the piano belongs to my late husband who just passed last month so I'm almost done moving my properties and I don't think my husband would be happy if i sell his piano so I'm giving it away,and I don't like seeing it around because of less storage so I'm hoping to give it to someone who is a passionate lover of instrument. It's currently going to be with the movers i employed to move my properties from my house..if you're really don't mind making new arrangement with the movers ,I can attempt to get in touch with them. This should not attract to many charges as the distance can be recovered within a day. I'm sorry for the inconvenience, but do let me know if you wish i get through to the movers .just so you know I'm not giving out scrap or waste, it's in an immaculate condition and yes it comes with a bench
I’m very excited it’s going to a good home. I got through to the movers now in order to let them know they will move the piano back.. All you need to do now is to contact them and make new arrangements as regards to the rerouting process. I also would like you to take some pictures when it arrives at your house and send them to me..

I received your email and thanks for your concern. The piano is still available. Please I'm giving out the Piano as a gift. Please attached to this email are the pictures of the instrument (Piano) just in case.
Now that you have seen the pictures of the piano, still interested in receiving it as a gift? I need to know before more information can be sent to you.
I will be expecting to receive your response.

Hello,
I received your email. Have tried gifting out the piano locally before, but they all keep complaining of not having enough space and the storage fee I paid on the piano was getting close to the expiration date. So, I'm happy to be gifting it out now.
Anyway, the Yamaha Baby Grand Piano GC1 model used to be owned and played by my late husband, who sadly passed away late last year. The dimensions of the piano are ""161cm by 149cm,"" and it was last tuned sometime before his passing. She's about 2 years old now and It's almost brand new, everything is working perfectly and sounding very well. So, you don't have anything to worry about having been well cared for by my late husband, who cherished it deeply.
As I am relocating to France and downsizing my living space, I am seeking to find a new home for the piano. I believe my late husband would want it to go to someone who shares his passion for music. I cannot bear to leave it behind in an empty house. Additionally, I am facing health issues and I will be undergoing surgery in the coming days, which is why it is crucial for the piano to find a new owner soon.
Currently, the piano is in storage in Little Rock, Arkansas, with the movers I hired for moving my properties. They are professional and can deliver the piano to your address without stress or damage. However, I will not be responsible for the cost of delivery the piano to your address and the mover's rates are reasonably affordable because of the storage charges i paid on the piano.
So, you are to reply back to this email as soon as possible before we can proceed because you need to be fine with this before I can get across to the movers and let them know about you and also send you the contact of the movers.
I will be waiting to receive your response.
Regards,
Mary.
Hello Michael,
I received your email.  I can understand. As regards delivery to your location, the movers are highly professional and the delivery fee is affordable due to the storage fee I paid on the piano. Anyway, I just sent the moving company a message and instructed them to release the piano to you and they shall also inform you about the actual cost to get it delivered to your provided address.
So, all you need to do now is to contact them via email and make an arrangement regarding the moving of the piano to your address. I would like you to take some pictures/videos when they arrive at your address.
Here is the mover's information,

"The person (***** *****l) used this email address to contact me: info@demopharm.org
The person (James O'Neal) claimed he was deaf and could only talk on Microsoft Teams; then, he did an online interview asking me questions to make him seem legit. Then, he offered me a job and stated that the company would pay for the office equipment, but he said that the money given to me was actually from a company in the U.S. that owed them money. He asked for my info, and I gave him my SSN, Drivers License, 2 of my credit cards, my address, personal friends, and phone numbers. All my identification information was given. He then asked me for my bank numbers; however, I did not provide that information. I gave him my credit login info on both of my credit cards because he said that I had to go out and purchase the office equipment with the money he credited to my credit cards. He also sent via email an acceptance welcome letter that did not specify what exactly were my duties at this company. He has credited the money to my credit cards, however I was told by several people that they purchase the office equipment with a fake check that was sent to them via mobile banking. Then, I further research this company, which is listed on a trusted job website which is Indeed.com), and found out that they have stolen information from a company and used it as a front for their scam. I asked the scammer to contact me via phone, and he refused. He did not answer the last question I asked which was can you call me. There is now a credit on my credit cards but I have not used the money. I asked him if he could send the money via CashApp, and he refused. The hourly wage that the company offer was $32.85 per hour. The following is a segment of the conversation, and this is what the scammer said:
(The company will provide you with a free new MacBook Pro laptop with a fast internet connection. You will get started with work as soon as your working materials and software are available.
You will be making an order for this software which you will be using to start work with. The vendor will install the software programs on the MacBook before mailing them to you, and the payment receipts and equipment will have your name on them because the equipment will become yours after 3-5 months of working with us. The training supervisor assigned to you will take you through those soft-wares. He will train you on how to use the software programs and when to use them. The software programs will be ready and active on your PC to enable you to work accurately with him
The working materials are the major equipment that you will be needing to set up a mini-office with. The working materials and equipment include all wooden materials and machines. The wooden materials are the office chair and table, and the office cabinet as well, if need be, etc. Do you understand?)
He then said the following:
As we commence with the preparations for your training, the company will issue you a check to enable you purchase all the office equipment and software's required to begin work with. You won't be required to reimburse the company for the check/equipment, but rather it will be the property of the company for the duration of your employment. Okay ?)
(Once you receive the check you are required to deposit it into your bank account. The money will typically be available in your account the next day, in the morning (24hrs) or less. Also, once the deposit is available, you are to deduct the $150.00 as your sign on bonus and the rest of the funds in your account will be for the purchase of your working  softwares, I will instruct you to purchase your working materials/equipment from the company's accredited/certified vendors at a discount rate because of the company's long-lasting relationship and agreement with them. We have reasons for this because the company specifies the software and office equipment. The vendor must install the software programs on the laptop before mailing them to you. Also, we will customize all materials in your name and the Company Logo and ship them to you via FedEx or DHL Global Logistics...Do you understand?)
(The check may be issued out by any of our 45 affiliated companies who owes Demo Pharmaceuticals some amount of money so this automatically serves as our refund as it is used solely for the benefit of our employees. I believe am understood?)
(For easier and faster process to enable you commence work asap and start earning your pay, The accounting department has decided to send you the check for your working material to you via email, You will be required to deposit the check electronically using your mobile banking app, Funds will be made available instantly or next day as soon as you deposit the check, you will be required to send a screen shot of the deposit confirmation receipt with your account number hidden for record purposes. Do you understand my instructions?)
This whole process did not make sense to me AT ALL.
Please alert others that this is a scam to get your personal and banking information. They will have you purchase the items and then reverse the credited payment. Others who have been victims of this company use fake checks, and the victim purchases the items; then, they are on the hook for the money they spend from their accounts. Please do something about this scammer. This is horrible, and my identity might be stolen at this point.

accountant is paying for this,  Do you accept checks via email? It is
the same as a regular check but you have to print it and deposit it
via your bank's mobile app and the money will be in your account
within 24 hours.
If you can accept this payment method, I can have the company
accountant include an extra $200 for you because I know I would prefer
to pay with a credit card or zelle or venmo but the accountant is an
older woman who still does things the old fashioned way. I will walk
you through the steps to deposit the check sent via email
Please send the total costs, your name and bank name for the e-check
to be made payable to and I'll send the information to the company

Your payment files from three (3) different banks, NatWest Bank of
London, Bank of Canada Bank of America was compiled and submitted to my desk this morning for review. The total sum owed to you
by the 3 banks mentioned above was sum up to the tune of US $57,500,000.00 (Fifty-Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars).
Now the fund has been totally lodged in one particular Escrow account (nondeductible) here in the Federal Reserve Bank New York on your name, while waiting for accreditation to your personal bank account in any part of the world.
Meanwhile, after due scrutiny and verification, I confirmed that you have fulfilled all the necessary obligations that will enable the release of your payment to you, but yet your payment was not released to you due to one flimsy excuse or the other from the Bank officials in charge of your payment, because they had the intention of diverting your funds to their private accounts in order to satisfy their selfish interest.
You are, however, lucky that we the management of the US Federal Reserve Bank detected their evil plans and therefore, call for the submission of your payment file to us so we can personally handle the payment assignment to ensure that you receive your funds accordingly.
Now, all modalities regarding your fund release have been put in place here in the Reserve Bank of America, thus, your funds have been made ready for transfer in our sophisticated macro transfer system, what we need from you now is to provide to us the bank account of your choice
which you want us to transfer your funds so we can expedite action for the accreditation of your funds into your account immediately.
Below is the information needed for your transfer.

Hello [target name removed],
Thanks for your message.
The Yamaha Baby Grand Piano GC1 model used to be owned and played by my husband who passed away last year, the dimension is ""161cm by 149cm”. It was last tuned two months ago. She's about 3 years old and in an impeccable condition.
I'm relocating to France next two weeks, and I don't think my husband will be happy if I sell this piano, so I'm hoping to give it out to someone who is a passionate lover of the instrument, I wasn't going to leave it alone in an empty house.
The Piano is currently in storage in Calgary, AB with the movers I employed to move my properties from my house. I can forward you the movers’ contact details to enable you to contact them. The movers can deliver anywhere. However, I will not be responsible for the cost of delivering the piano to you. However, the movers' rates are reasonably affordable.
I look forward to your reply.

Very much hope to hear from you today. Just combining my two emails of yesterday.
Firstly, Thank you for what feels like an incredibly generous offer. Incredibly generous.
We are so touched by this gesture of you wanting to keep the music playing and accessible to the youth. I am really delighted you are interested in us taking custody of your piano.
We feel it would be prudent to have one of our musicians just come by and briefly play it if possible - before we arrange to move forward and pay the movers to deliver. I don’t want to make a problem for you, as i’m sure you have many things to organise, but we would like to test it very much before committing.
Would this be possible? We could visit the movers facility perhaps?

We are so touched by this gesture of you wanting to keep the music playing and accessible to the youth. I am really delighted you are interested in us taking custody of your piano.
We feel it would be prudent to have one of our musicians just come by and briefly play it if possible - before we arrange to move forward and pay the movers to deliver. I don’t want to make a problem for you, as i’m sure you have many things to organise, but we would like to test it very much before committing.
Would this be possible? We could visit the movers facility perhaps?
Our address is **** ********* *** *** *****.

If you're interested in it.
Could you please share your address and phone number so I can pass it along to them to plan the route and calculate the cost? I also want to inform you that they require payment before delivery, as it's their policy to collect payment upfront to cover expenses related to disassembling and assembling the piano, delivery, and insurance. The charges should be minimal since I've already covered the main costs, you’ll only need to pay the difference.

Dear Katherine,
I am very so sorry for your loss, which was so recently and I wanted to give our warm wishes to you and respect for getting things organised so fast.
Before being able to comment and ask you to speak to your movers, are you able to give
me a little more on the model, as we have a size issue and am concerned what you have which I think is a full Grand - may be too big without us removing windows.
If you can give me the model I can check the size on the internet.
Warm wishes for your evening, ****

Hello ****, Thank you for your interest in the piano. The Steinway belonged to my late husband, who played it as recently as February before his passing. While I’m in the process of moving my belongings, I know my husband, with his deep love and attachment to the instrument, wouldn’t have wanted it to be sold. I’m hoping to pass it on to someone who shares his passion for music and has a genuine love for the piano.
The first person I had in mind unfortunately didn’t follow through, and since I don’t intend to sell it, the piano is currently with the movers handling my relocation. However, if you’re interested, I can try to arrange for the movers to reroute it to you. It shouldn’t incur too much additional cost, as the distance can be covered within a day or two.
Please let me know if you would like me to reach out to the movers. Just so you know, the piano is in excellent condition,it’s far from being something discarded or wasted

Summary: We are looking to give a loved piano a good home surrounded by art and appreciation.
Dear Katherine,
I have been past your address by someone on facebook where your piano was advertised.
My name is **** ***** and I am working with ***** *********, owner of ******** Gallery of **********. ***** has been in business here in D.C. since 1973 and during the summer we repainted and rehung the three story corner property on P Street and have started hosting some charity fundraising events within the gallery spaces.
We have been borrowing key boards and pianos which are then played by professional musicians and piano students from Howard University.
We have been inspired to find a piano to live with us after taking advice from a wonderful pianist called Dr ******* ******** (a nice story here if you can access instagram).
***** and I also have two young children who are nearly old enough to learn, and hope we will also be able to use this instrument to bring music into their lives.
My contact details are below (we are currently setting up a new website and emails hence my using my personal email).
I am very happy to speak on the phone or invite you to the gallery to see the space. If we were to move forward - we would want to visit the instrument with one of our regular student musicians to just check it out - as you know, specialist moving costs for such an instrument are significant and we have to be certain it will fit (!) and work for us.
If you google @lenfantgallery instagram you can see more images of the spaces. The size would depend if we can get it up the stairs or not.
Very much look forward to hearing from you,",legitimate_email,0.9985193610191345,"{'legitimate_email': 0.9985193610191345, 'phishing_url': 0.0014754069270566106, 'legitimate_url': 2.371246637267177e-06, 'phishing_url_alt': 2.8056772407580866e-06}"

>> Why did your antivirus not detect malware?
>> Answer: The malware I used is driver-based, I update its signatures every 4 hours. Hence your antivirus is unable to detect its presence.

"Received said email this morning, Wednesday, December 4, 2024 at 07:57 AM from a M,s. Kylie Gomez, allegedly from, ""Integrity Publishing, LLC.""  The referenced email was sent to my email:  ********************** with the heading, ""Amazon's Book Recommendation.""
The following is the body of the email content:
""Dear ***** ******* Your published book has been forwarded to us by Amazon who is the distributor of your book across America and the rest of the world, and it is chosen for a republishing opportunity here at Integrity Publishing.  Having said that, Amazon saw potential in your book not just based on your credentials and credibility but because of the book's quality.  We are also willing to partly invest in your book, so you won't have to worry that much.  However, those interested in your book have some concerns about your book being expensive, price wise, making it difficult for bookstores to see benefits in buying and selling it.  Almost all printers in the US would confirm that the cost of printing your book is far too low compared to the retail price set by your publisher which is so much for the buyers to handle.
With this in mind, as per recommendation we would like to let you know that we can get your book republished and printed at the price of your preference basing on its printing cost so you could sell your book at the most competitive book price to your buyers without having to sacrifice everything that you have done for your book and don't worry because you will still have a full control on your book from production to publication.
This demand and interest being shown to your book is now the effect of your efforts on continuously marketing your project.
Looking forward to discussing the details so we can make it happen.  If you are interested, please respond in this email with your active phone number and physical address.

Facts:  Although I have written a book that was broken into two separate books, the only publishing that occurred both times, I had the entire copies printed out respectively being at:  Poteau, Oklahoma Public Library and Office Depot in Tukwila, WA.
I do have an Amazon account that I just took off, ""pause hiatus,"" as of yesterday but, said account is of personal use and has never said anything about my books.
I have had some of my, ""opinion,"" writings published in the forms of:  Letter to the Editor (SouthWest Times, Fort Smith, AR), a few online articles:  Chicken Soup for the Soul, a roller derby magazine and most recently on a website for Survivor's of Traumatic Childhood Abuse and some poetry here and there.
I also wrote the team mantra still being used at present for the LeFlore County Maidens of Mayhem of Poteau, Oklahoma and a few personal funeral eulogies and pamphlet poems distributed.
Upon reading the email mentioned above, I found it too coincidental that the name was a mix of two (2) social celebrities well known around all social platforms as well as in Hollywood and the music industry etc.:  Kylie Jenner and Selena Gomez.  I also knew that my books had NEVER BEEN published by any company and definitely NOT by Amazon.  I did click on the website link out of curiosity where as soon as the website loaded, noticed the word, ""quote,"" was spelled incorrectly (red flag for a publishing company) and quickly exited the website and upon reading the email again, I also noticed multiple grammatical errors etc.
Also, in this email the address stated for the company does NOT contain or list the actual address but instead, lists the street name, city and state only obviously also leaving the zip code out as well.
I then started researching Ms. Kylie and her company where I came across the previous submission on this website prior to mine now.
I also want to add that I found another interesting coincidence:  The phone number given for Ms. Kylie, ************ eerily enough contains *** which is my current first three (3) ***** ** ** ***** ****** ***** *** **** **** ***** *** *** *** **** **** ****** *** *** **** *** **** ******* *** **** **** *** ** ** ******** ***** ****** **** ***** ** *** ******* ** * ** *** ******** **** ***** **** **** ***** * **** ******* * ***** *** *** *****",phishing_url,0.969755232334137,"{'legitimate_email': 0.030216708779335022, 'phishing_url': 0.969755232334137, 'legitimate_url': 1.8646696844371036e-05, 'phishing_url_alt': 9.411472092324402e-06}"

Due to fraudulent activity, your Social Security Number (SSN) will be suspended within the next 24 hours.
We are writing this letter to notify you that your social security number is being suspended due to FTC's discovery of illegal activity using your identity in the state of TEXAS.
Your case is referred to the Department of Justice for prosecution under the Criminal Code Act 1950, and other criminal offence in the state of TEXAS, including the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 for:
Count 1 (Drug Trafficking) Act 258 Section D
Count 2 (Money Laundering) *** Act of 1986
Count 3 (Theft by deception) Texas Supreme Court Code conduct 1986.
A legal complaint has been filed against you as of today. In line with our usual operating processes, law enforcement agencies have discovered 25 bank accounts established using your Social Security information to commit a $14 million scam. These accounts were used across the whole state of New Mexico for illegal operations such as money laundering, drug trafficking, and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) fraud.
The Department attempted to serve legal process at your most recent known address, but US Marshals who paid a visit found the house deserted.
